# Final Project Title : Fire Slayer 

# Description : 
In 'Fire Slayer', the player will be able to control a 'slayer' that will appear at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the slayer left and right using the arrow keys, and shoot bullets at the dragon. Once the game starts the dragon will breathe fire down to the slayer, and the slayers job is to dodge the fire and shoot the dragon. If the player is successful in killing the dragon, the player moves to the next round, where it progressively gets more difficult. The slayer will now have to dodge a dragon that breathes fire at a faster rate and has more health than the dragon before it. However with the increase in levels, the player has a probabilty of picking up perks from the dragon once he kills him. For example, upon killing the dragon, he might drop metal armor, extra health, or even a stronger weapon. If the fire hits the player then he drops health. If his health reaches zero then the game restarts and the player will start again from level 1. The game will have 5 levels in total. with each level having its own unique challenges. 

# Libraries Used :
For this game to actually work, ill be using the Pygame library. Ill be also using Tkinter,PIL,sys,random. which all come installed in python. 

# User Interface : 
The main page will consist of two buttons, Start and Instructions. If the player chooses instruction, which they should before playing, then a screen will appear and it will consist of all the controls that you need to know about, to play the game correctly. the Start button, will take you to the actual game. The background looks like a dungeon and on the top right corner you will have your health displayed and on the left the current dragons health. 

# First Milestone Features(NOV 24) :
- For my first checkpoint i'd like to create a slayer that is able to move smoothly left and right and shoot bullets when the player presses the space bar.
- Create the dragon and have it breathe fire. 

# Final set of complete features : 
- Have the health function working properly where as whenever he gets hit the slayer will lose one bar of health and vice versa. 
- Finish all the levels, add the probability of the dragon dropping special perks and implement them. 
- Make sure game runs smoothly.
